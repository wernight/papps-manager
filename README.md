papps-manager
=============

**Portable applications manager** that can add/remove/update all major portable applications and compatible ones.


Features
--------

So far, none. Under heavy work, but please send your *love*.


Development
-----------

It's a **WPF** application using **[MVVM](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg405484.aspx)** powered by [Caliburn.Micro](http://caliburnmicro.codeplex.com/documentation).

You'll need preferably **[Visual Studio 2012](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/products/visual-studio-overview)** (but *Visual Studion 2010* is also possible) and then simply open the solution file. *NuGet* plug-in will then retrieve the required dependencies. We also recommend you get [ReSharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) (with default settings) to help keep the code lean and consistent.
