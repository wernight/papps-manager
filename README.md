papps-manager
=============

**Portable applications manager** for *Windows* that can add/remove/update all major portable applications and compatible ones, for [http://compareason.com/](compareason.com).

Requires *[.NET Framework 4.5](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653)*.


Features
--------

So far, none. Under heavy work, but please send your *love*.


Development
-----------

It's a **.NET 4.5** **WPF** application written in **C#** using **[MVVM](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg405484.aspx)** powered by *[Caliburn.Micro](http://caliburnmicro.codeplex.com/documentation)* among other libraries.

You'll need preferably **[Visual Studio 2012](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/products/visual-studio-overview)** and then simply open the solution file. *NuGet* plug-in will then retrieve the required dependencies. We also recommend you get [ReSharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) (with default settings) to help keep the code lean and consistent.
